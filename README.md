This code is deprecated.  I decided that it would be better to begin using `imdbpy` for data acquisition and JSON to hold the data, which made the two biggest contributions here, a custom web-scraper and SQL exporting, irrelevant.  Furthermore, I created a better implementation for the base class, but incorporating it would have required a complete rewrite of this codebase. Rather than refactor a lot of now-irrelevant code, I have archived this repository and moved development to my `genre_explorer` repository.
